                <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is developed by ISO/IEC, and the typing discipline is
                    made stronger. SQL is a domain-specific language developed to manage the data and kept in a
                    relational database management system. The statements are used to perform many operations on a
                    database, such as retrieval of data, updating data, removing and renaming data, and deleting data.
                    We cannot call
                    SQL a programming language, but it has some standards to create procedural extensions so that the
                    functionalities can be extended to form a programming language. Here are the different types of
                    commands:</p>

                        cannot be retrieved.</li>

                <p>Logical design, also known as data model mapping, involves converting the conceptual schema into a

                    by frequently used transactions are retrieved from the database as quickly as possible. Physical
                    design involves choosing the specific storage structure of database files</p>

                    used. The implementation phase involves compiling and executing data definition language commands to
                    create the database, automatically or manually populating the database</p>
