                <h3>1. Requirement Analysis</h3>
                <p>The purpose of requirement analysis is to collect what users need or want to be able to do
                    with the database. The goal is to convert an informal description of requirements into a formal
                    specification</p>

                <h3>2. Conceptual Design</h3>
                <p>The purpose of conceptual design is to produce a high-level data model that can be understood by
                    everyone, including non-technical users. </p>

                <p>The purpose of choosing a DBMS is to establish which framework is best, technically, economically and
                    organizationally, for implementing the database</p>

                <h3>4. Logical Design</h3>
                <p>Logical design, also known as data model mapping, involves converting the conceptual schema into a
                    data model for the chosen DBMS. The logical design is a set of data definition language commands in
                    the language
                    of the chosen DBMS.</p>

                <h3>5. Physical Design</h3>
                <p>The emphasis of physical design is typically on database performance, such that data items referenced
                    by frequently used transactions are retrieved from the database as quickly as possible. Physical
                    design involves choosing the specific storage structure of database files</p>
            </div>

                <h3>6. Implementation</h3>
                <p>The purpose of implementation is to physically create and populate the database so that it can be
                    used. The implementation phase involves compiling and executing data definition language commands to
                    create the database, automatically or manually populating the database</p>

                <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is developed by ISO/IEC, and the typing discipline is
                    made stronger. SQL is a domain-specific language developed to manage the data and kept in a
                    relational database management system. The statements are used to perform many operations on a
                    database, such as retrieval of data, updating data, removing and renaming data, and deleting data. We cannot call
                    SQL a programming language, but it has some standards to create procedural extensions so that the
                    functionalities can be extended to form a programming language. Here are the different types of
                    commands:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Select: </strong>This is the same as the projection operation of relational algebra. It
                        is used to select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Select Into: </strong>This command is used to select data from one table and insert it

                    <li><strong>Update</strong> This command is used to update the value of any record in the database.

                <p>The transaction is a set of commands that perform a specific task on objects in a single unit of
                    execution. So TCL commands deals with transactions in a database.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commit</strong>This command is used to commits a transaction. Once committed, it cannot
                        be rolled back. This means the previous image of the database before running this transaction
                        cannot be retrieved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rollback</strong>Rollback is used to revert the steps in transactions if an error
                        occurs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Savepoint</strong> This command sets a savepoint in the transaction to which steps can
                        be rolled back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set Transation</strong>This command is used to set the characteristics of the
