                <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is developed by ISO/IEC, and the typing discipline is
                    made stronger. SQL is a domain-specific language developed to manage the data and kept in a
                    relational database management system. The statements are used to perform many operations on a
                    database, such as retrieval of data, updating data, removing and renaming data, and deleting data.
                    We cannot call
                    SQL a programming language, but it has some standards to create procedural extensions so that the
                    functionalities can be extended to form a programming language. Here are the different types of
                    commands:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Select: </strong>This is the same as the projection operation of relational algebra. It
                        is used to select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Select Into: </strong>This command is used to select data from one table and insert it

                    <li><strong>Update</strong> This command is used to update the value of any record in the database.

                <p>The transaction is a set of commands that perform a specific task on objects in a single unit of
                    execution. So TCL commands deals with transactions in a database.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commit</strong>This command is used to commits a transaction. Once committed, it cannot
                        be rolled back. This means the previous image of the database before running this transaction
                        cannot be retrieved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rollback</strong>Rollback is used to revert the steps in transactions if an error
                        occurs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Savepoint</strong> This command sets a savepoint in the transaction to which steps can
                        be rolled back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set Transation</strong>This command is used to set the characteristics of the
                        transaction.</li>

                <p>These types of queries are used to define the structure of data. Like the structure of a table,
                    schema and modify it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create: </strong>This command is used to create tables, database, schema etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drop: </strong>This command is used to drop tables and other database objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alter:</strong>This command is used to alter the definition of database objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Truncate: </strong>This command is used to remove tables, procedures, views, and other
                        database objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Column: </strong>This command is used to add any column to the table schema.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drop Column:</strong>This command is used to drop a column from any table structure.

                <p>The purpose of requirement analysis is to collect what users need or want to be able to do
                    with the database. The goal is to convert an informal description of requirements into a formal
                    specification</p>

                    everyone, including non-technical users. </p>

                <h3>4. Logical Design</h3>
                <p>Logical design, also known as data model mapping, involves converting the conceptual schema into a
                    data model for the chosen DBMS. The logical design is a set of data definition language commands in
                    the language
                    of the chosen DBMS.</p>

                <h3>5. Physical Design</h3>
                <p>The emphasis of physical design is typically on database performance, such that data items referenced
                    by frequently used transactions are retrieved from the database as quickly as possible. Physical
                    design involves choosing the specific storage structure of database files</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3>6. Implementation</h3>
                <p>The purpose of implementation is to physically create and populate the database so that it can be
                    used. The implementation phase involves compiling and executing data definition language commands to
                    create the database, automatically or manually populating the database</p>
